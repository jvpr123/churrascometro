Churrascometro is a simple website created to help the user to find out how much food and drink it needs for a barbecue.

### How does it works?

To calculate the quantity of meat, beer and soda/water the barbecue requires, the user must fill the the fields **'Adults'**, **'Children'** and **'Duration'**. After clicking on **'Calculate'**, the page will return a box telling the user the quantitiy of each item required.
At this point, the user can also copy the itens to clipboard in order to save it in his own device or share it with someone else.
